INDEX
Indexes are essential for optimizing query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate rows without scanning the entire table
Index are often on a column used for filtering (date, location, ...) or primary key 
Avoid use index with columns have null value
Index do take storage space that we will have to pay for
An index is only effective for queries that include a `WHERE` condition on the indexed column.
*/

-- Sử dụng index là việc scan trên 2 table. Tức là scan index table trước, sau đó ánh xạ kết quả sang table chính.
-- Trong một số trường hợp, PostgreSQL sẽ tự đưa ra query execution phù hợp
---- Example 1:
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM ENGINEER WHERE COUNTRY_ID >= 100;
    -- Query plan 
        -- Seq Scan on engineer (cost=0.00..2367.00 rows=58427 width=52) (actual time=0.020..820.922 rows=58497 loops=1)
        --   Filter: (country_id >= 100)
        --   Rows removed by Filter: 41503
        -- Planning time: 0.217 ms
        -- Execution time: 1570.828 ms
---- Example 2:
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM ENGINEER WHERE COUNTRY_ID >= 150;
    -- Query plan
        -- Bitmap Heap Scan on engineer (cost=421.86..2005.89 rows=37363 width=52) (actual time=3.614..525.345 rows=37363 loops=1)
        --   Recheck Cond: (country_id >= 150)
        --   Heap Blocks: exact=1117
        --   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_engineer_country_id (cost=0.00..412.51 rows=37363 width=52) (actual time=3.315..3.323 rows=37759 loops=1)
        --         Index Cond: (country_id >= 150)
        -- Planning time: 0.202 ms
        -- Execution time: 1011.887 ms
/* 
Lí do country_id >= 100 sử dụng seq scan còn country_id >= 150 vì với ới điều kiện >= 100, có rất nhiều records phù hợp. 
Do đó query execution xác định rằng seq scan trên table chính còn nhanh hơn việc scan index trên table index 
rồi sau đó mất công look-up sang table chính
*/

-- a. B-Tree Index (Balanced Tree Index) (Default)
--     B-Tree index uses the **Binary Tree** data structure for storage, and Binary Search Tree (BST) is employed to perform searches.
--     Best for equality and range queries.
--     Suitable for =, <, >, <=, >=, and BETWEEN.
--     Efficient for large tables with high cardinality.
--     Efficient for columns with sequential or increasing data (e.g., ID, date).
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING BTREE(column_name);
---- Example 1: Create an index on the "date" column of the "orders" table
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders (date);

--- Bitmap Index
/*
Bản chất của bitmap index vẫn sử dụng cấu trúc B-Tree, tuy nhiên nó lưu trữ thông tin khác với B-Tree index. 
B-Tree index mapping index với một hoặc nhiều rowId. 
Bitmap index mapping index với giá trị bit tương ứng của column. 
Ví dụ có 3 giá trị của gender: Male, Female, Unknown. Tạo ra 3 bit tương ứng 0, 1, 2 cho 3 giá trị đó và mapping với column trong table chính.

Tính chất:
    - Phù hợp với các column low cardinality.
    - Lưu bit cho mỗi giá trị nên giảm dung lượng lưu trữ cần dùng.
    - Chỉ hiệu quả với tìm kiếm full match value.
    - Kết hợp với nhiều index khác để tăng tốc độ với OR, AND.
Hạn chế:
    - Nếu thêm hoặc bớt một giá trị cần build lại toàn bộ index table. Với B-Tree index chỉ cần re-balance tree.
    - Với PostgreSQL, bitmap index được lưu trên memory vì size của nó khá nhỏ, từ đó tăng tốc độ truy vấn. 
        Vì vậy khi restart nó cần build lại toàn bộ bitmap index. 
        Để tránh nhược điểm này, trong thực tế sẽ sử dụng kết hợp với column khác tạo thành composite index.
*/


-- b. Hash Index
--     Optimized for equality comparisons (=). (Faster than B-Tree)
--     Not as versatile as B-Tree.
--     Suitable for columns with a small number of distinct values.
--     Not suitable for columns with high cardinality or sequential data.
--     Can't create 'composite index' with hash index
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING hash (column_name);
---- Example 2: Create a unique index on the "id" column of the "customers" table
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id_hash ON users USING hash (user_id);

/*
** Note:
Số lượng buckets (xô) trong bảng băm và số lượng rows (dòng) không nhất thiết phải bằng nhau 
vì buckets không được tạo dựa trên số dòng mà dựa trên một số tiêu chí tối ưu hóa bộ nhớ và tốc độ truy vấn
1. Bucket là gì?
    Một bucket là một "xô" dùng để lưu trữ các dòng dữ liệu sau khi hashing value.
    Mỗi giá trị trong bảng hash sẽ được gán vào một bucket cụ thể dựa trên hash function.
    PostgreSQL thường tạo số lượng buckets theo bội số của 2, tối thiểu là 1024 hoặc lớn hơn nếu cần.
    Số lượng buckets lớn hơn giúp phân phối các dòng đều hơn, giảm xung đột, giúp việc kiểm tra từng bucket nhanh hơn

--     Efficient for very large tables with sequentially ordered data (e.g., date or increasing ID columns).
--     Stores data ranges instead of individual values.
--     Saves storage compared to B-Tree.

-- h. Unique Index
--     Ensures that all values in the indexed column are unique.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
---- Example 8: Create a unique index on the "email" column of the "customers" table
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_customers_email ON customers (email);

-- Covering Index (INCLUDE)
--     An extension of B-Tree Index, allowing additional columns to be stored for query optimization without indexing them directly.
--     Reducing the index size.
--     Useful when querying a subset of columns.
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name1, column_name2) INCLUDE (column_name3, column_name4);
---- Example 9: Create a covering index on the "name" and "email" columns of the "customers" table
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_name_email ON customers (name, email) INCLUDE (phone);

--- A. Veritcal Partitioning
/*
Vertical partitioning in SQL involves splitting a table into multiple smaller tables based on columns.

--- Add-ins 1: Sharding
/*
Sharding is a database design technique that divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces known as shards. 
Each shard is a sub-table that holds a subset of the data, with each row existing in exactly one shard
Partition key: Primary Key
*/

--- Add-ins 2:
/*
        Each partition is considered a separate table and inherits the characteristics of the parent table. 
        Indexes can be added to individual partitions to enhance query performance, referred to as 'local indexes'. 
        Alternatively, indexes can be added to the parent table, known as 'global indexes'.

        Nếu 1 bảng không có Primary Key, có thể tạo bao nhiêu Partition cũng được
        Nếu 1 bảng có Primary Key, thì chỉ có thể tạo Partition cho các column thuộc PK đó
        Nếu 1 bảng có cột UNIQUE (ex: id begserial UNIQUE NOT NULL), thì chỉ có thể tạo Partition cho cột đó
        
        The essence of partitioning lies in dividing a dataset into independent partitions based on predefined conditions. 
        To adhere to this principle, overlapping keys across partitions are not allowed. 
        In simple terms, a single record cannot belong to more than one partition, and partition keys must neither overlap nor partially intersect with each other.

-- MATERIALIZED VIEW
/*
A materialized view in PostgreSQL is a database object that stores the result of a query physically on disk. 
Unlike a regular view, which dynamically computes the result each time it is queried, a materialized view caches the result, allowing for faster query performance. 
However, the data in a materialized view does not automatically stay up to date and must be refreshed to reflect changes in the underlying tables.
*/

    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, c.country_name
	    FROM ENGINEER e JOIN COUNTRY c ON e.country_id = c.id;

--> Use REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW to update the data.

-- JOIN

/*
Three common join algorithms used in relational databases
    Nested loop join.
    Hash join.
    Merge join.
*/

--** PostgreSQL always determines the most optimal type of join to use for a query.

-- 1. Nested loop join
/*
    - The nested loop join is the simplest join algorithm.
    - It compares each row from the first table with all rows from the second table.
    - This approach is simple but can be slow for large datasets.
*/
/*
Steps in a Nested Loop Join:
    Outer Loop (Driver Relation): The database takes each row from the outer table (or dataset) one at a time.
    Inner Loop (Probed Relation): For each row in the outer loop, it scans all rows in the inner table to check for matches based on the join condition.
    Match Check: If the join condition evaluates to true (e.g., matching keys for equality join), the algorithm produces the combined result of the matching rows.
**Inner Loop stops only when the column contains a unique value. If not, the scan will not stop upon finding a match but will continue to scan the entire join table.
*/

SELECT * FROM ENGINEER e JOIN COUNTRY c ON e.country_id = c.id;

-- To optimize Nested loop join --> use Index

-- 2. Hash join
/*
    - The hash join algorithm is a more efficient join algorithm.
    - It first builds a hash table from the smaller table (the one that is probed).
    - Then, it scans the larger table and looks up the matching rows in the hash table.
    - This approach is more efficient than the nested loop join for large datasets.
    - It is only suitable for joins with equality (`=`) conditions.
*/
/*

    Build Hash Table: The database builds a hash table from the smaller table (the one that is probed).
    Probe Hash Table: The database scans the larger table and looks up the matching rows in the hash table.

*/
SELECT * FROM ENGINEER e JOIN COUNTRY c ON e.country_id = c.id;

-- 3. Merge Join (sort-merge join)
/*
    - The merge join algorithm is a more efficient join algorithm.
    - It first sorts both tables based on the join condition.
    - Then, it scans both tables simultaneously and compares the rows.
    - This approach is more efficient than the nested loop join for large datasets.
    - It is only suitable for joins with equality (`=`) conditions.
*/

/*
Steps in a Merge Join:
    Sort Tables: The database sorts both tables based on the join condition.
    Merge Tables: The database scans both tables simultaneously and compares the rows.
    Match Check: If the join condition evaluates to true (e.g., matching keys for equality join), the algorithm produces the combined result of the matching rows.
*/
SELECT * FROM ENGINEER e JOIN COUNTRY c ON e.country_id = c.id;
-- *The computation cost and execution time can be quite high, even greater than a nested loop join, due to the need to sort the tables.

-- CONCURRENCY CONTROL (LOCK)
-- Concurrency control in SQL is crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity in multi-user environments.
/* 
A. Pessimistic Lock (Pessimistic Concurrency Control) - PPC
When transaction T(1) starts and modifies data, it locks the row, page, or table depending on the query conditions. 
Subsequent transactions T(x) cannot modify the data in that row and must wait until T(1) is completed.
    How It Works:
    - Transaction Start: A transaction begins by acquiring locks on the data it intends to read or modify.
        Shared Lock: Allows multiple transactions to read the data but prevents writes.
        Exclusive Lock: Prevents both reads and writes by other transactions.
    - Transaction Execution: The transaction performs operations while holding locks.
    - Commit: Locks are released after the transaction commits.
    - Rollback: Locks are released if the transaction rolls back.
*/

/*
B. Optimistic Lock (Optimistic Concurrency Control) - OCC
Instead of locking rows during the update process, optimistic lock only applies the lock at the time of committing the update.
    How It Works:
    - Transaction Start: A transaction begins by reading data.
    - Transaction Execution: The transaction performs operations locally without locking the database rows.
    - Conflict Detection: At commit time, the system checks whether the data being modified has changed since it was read. 
    If the data has been modified by another transaction, the current transaction is rolled back.
    - Commit: If no conflicts are detected, the transaction is committed.
*/

/*
Feature	                Optimistic Concurrency Control          Pessimistic Concurrency Control
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conflict Handling	    Detects conflicts at commit time	    Prevents conflicts upfront
Locks	                No locks during transaction	            Uses locks to control access
Transaction Rollbacks	May require rollbacks for conflicts	    Rarely requires rollbacks
Throughput	            Higher in low-contention scenarios	    Lower due to blocking in contention
Use Case	            Low contention, read-heavy systems	    High contention, write-heavy systems

When to Use Which?
*Optimistic: Use OCC when most transactions are read-only or updates to the same data are rare. 
    Examples include analytics, reporting, and distributed systems with eventual consistency.
*Pessimistic: Use PCC when data integrity is critical, and there is frequent contention for the same data. 
    Examples include banking systems, ticket booking platforms, and inventory management systems.

/*
Shared locks and exclusive locks are two types of locks used in SQL databases to manage concurrent access to data. 
These locks are part of the concurrency control mechanism, ensuring data consistency and integrity while allowing multiple transactions to run simultaneously.
*/

-- 1. Shared Lock (read lock)
/*
Purpose:
    Allows read-only access to a resource (e.g., a table or row).
    Multiple transactions can hold a shared lock on the same resource simultaneously.

Behavior:
    Shared locks are used for read operations (e.g., SELECT statements with certain isolation levels).
    Prevents other transactions from modifying the resource while it is being read.
    Does not block other shared locks but blocks exclusive locks.

Example: Suppose Transaction A holds a shared lock on a row:
    Transaction A can read the row.
    Transaction B can also acquire a shared lock and read the row simultaneously.
    Transaction C cannot acquire an exclusive lock (needed for writing) until both shared locks are released.
*/

-- 2. Exclusive Lock (X-Lock)
/*
Purpose:
    Allows write access to a resource.
    Ensures that no other transaction can read or write the resource while the exclusive lock is held.

Behavior:
    Exclusive locks are used for write operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).
    Blocks both shared locks and other exclusive locks.

Example: Suppose Transaction A holds an exclusive lock on a row:
    Transaction A can modify the row.
    Transaction B cannot acquire a shared or exclusive lock on the same row until Transaction A releases its exclusive lock.
